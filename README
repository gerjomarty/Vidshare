Vidshare README
---------------

Hello. This was my Part II Project for Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. It is a video broadcasting application that streams video to other users of the application over Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, who in turn broadcast to nodes within range of them.

It utilises version 0.2 of the Haggle Project (http://www.haggleproject.org/), a data transmission framework designed for mobile phones that propagates data objects over ad-hoc wireless.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

Version 0.2 of Haggle only worked properly with Android 1.5 (Cupcake), so Vidshare was programmed specifically for Cupcake and will not work with other versions of Android.

Furthermore, the devices supported seemed to be very limited. I tested on a HTC Magic (/ Android Developer Phone 2 / Google Ion).

Haggle needs to be installed on all devices to be used, hence the phone will need to be rooted for Haggle to be installed.

As this is an undergrad Compsci project, it works just as smoothly as you'd expect -- not very. When streaming, video blacks out every three seconds for approximately one second, due to limitations in Cupcake. This makes it effectively useless in practice.


INSTALLATION
------------

Why the hell you'd want to after reading the previous section, I have no idea. But here's a quick guide anyway.

1. Install Haggle 0.2 from the Google Code page (http://code.google.com/p/haggle/). The pre-compiled binary (haggle-0.2-android-bin.tar.gz) should suffice. Installation info is on the wiki on the same site.

2. Ensure you follow the guide to enable ad-hoc wireless on Android 1.5, as there is no interface to change this in the settings.

3. Install the APK on your phone and hope for the best.
